SweptSurface
More efficient representation for surface tessellation, don't use 2d arrays
More exact srf-srf intersection
Marching surface-Surface intersection
SurfaceClosestPoint occasionally fails when point is far from surface - need to check for wild derivatives
Curve interpolation with sparse matrices
Curve approximation
verb.eval.Make.interpCurve with tangents is numerically unstable, implementation likely wrong
